To configure your API for unit tests create a file in this directory called "apikey.secrets". 
Place just your API key in this file. 
Set "Copy to output directory" in properties to "Copy if newer" or "Copy always". 
The .gitignore is configured to ignore any file with the .secrets extension. 

DO NOT EVER COMMIT YOUR API TO PUBLIC SOURCE CONTROL.
It's good practice to never any commit secrets to source control.
In the event that you do commit your API key to source control, remember that your key will always be persisted in the source control history.
Recommitting excluding the file will not erase your key from publication.
Roll your API key on the Quandl site as soon as you can.
